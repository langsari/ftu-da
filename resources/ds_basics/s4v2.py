Couldn't we just populate the array with the actual data? What's the point in placeholding two empty elements in the array? I guess we're just getting really explict about what we want?

I guess this makes sense as the write brand and price file function is wants to write a file not return vales. The other way to do this would be to write out all of the write to file function as the end of the write brand and price file function, but DRY says to just reuse the function.
